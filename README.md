# DATASET 
Dataset name: Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)database
No of records(tuples): 699 records No of attributes:11 attributes
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The proposed  model is used to help medical researchers to analyse and predict the breast cancer cells in human body by analysing the breast cancer dataset and thus determine if the resultant cells are cancerous or not. The proposed model tends to exhibit the use of Decision tree classification algorithm implementation using Jupyter Notebook in Python to visualize the data and find out the optimal accuracy of the model.
# OUTPUT
The decision tree algorithms employed in python resulted into an efficient model with accuracy 94.16% which can very evidently state whether a particular cell is benign or malignant.
